Welcome to Go to The Point! Here is the tutorial level of the game. 
Before starting, please wear devices according to the instructions on the back of the map.
Good, you have got the gear on!
The white and orange flags you can see are control points. 
The control point next to you is the initial point.
In orienteering, you start your trip from the initial control point.  
Now, try stepping and moving to the first control point in front of you. 
Remember to stop for a few seconds to wait for the control point to record the time.
