Good job, you have reached the first control point. 
Now, let me introduce you every element on the screen.
On the left-bottom corner, there is a compass with the north arrow, and the red pointer always points north.
You need to find your position and way to your next control point with the compass and the map in your hand. 
The texts on the right-top corner of the screen are the current time, the time of your last control point, and your next control point.
In orienteering, players should try to pass the control points in the order indicated on the map in an as short time as possible. 
Therefore, you need to determine your location and find the appropriate path to the next control point.
Now, try to find and reach your next point!
