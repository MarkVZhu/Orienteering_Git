Good job, you have reached the first contol point. 
Now, let me introduce you every element on the screen.
On the left-bottom corner, there is a compass with the north arrow, and the red pointer always points north.
You need to find your position and way to your next contol point with the compass and the map on your hand. 
The texts on the right-top corner of the screen are current time, the time of your last contol point, and your next contol point.
In an orienteering, players should try to pass the contol points in the order indicated on the map in as short time as possible. 
Therefore, you need to determine your location and find the appropriate path to the next control point.
Now, try to find and reach your next point!
