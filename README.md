# WKU CPS4951 Group#15 Project: ROOM
## Introduction  
In the WKU CPS4951 course, our group builds this game: ROOM. Room is a story-oriented and suspenseful game, and we want to warn people away from drugs 
with this game. In ROOM, we made a lot of metaphors about drugs. This git repository contains all the assets and scripts of our project.
The following picture is the logo of ROOM.

## Design
This game uses the puzzle in levels to tell the story of a person on drugs. In his last moments of life, he tried saving himself and discovering the truth. The player learns the reality behind all the mysteries around him by taking on the role and searching for answers in different rooms. In ROOM, players can experience the discomfort and pain of man on drugs,and the designs of scenes, interactions, and stories in the game all do tell the player how dangerous drugs are.  

## Art
The artist in our group has decided on the art style, an abnormal world after the main character takes the drug, of the game including building the map modifying the idea of the game designer into a more vivid and attractive expression, deciding and re-design the game assert to exhibit the atmosphere of a strange abandoned hospital after main character taking drugs.

## Program
Because in ROOM there are platform and plane two kinds of gameplay perspective, we set up two sets of input system (InputController2D.cs & InputController2DPlatform. cs).  These scripts are bound within the scene Controller (GameObject), and interact with CharacterController2D.cs and CharacterController2DPlatform.cs on Character (GameObject). Hence, players can use different input modes in different levels.  In addition, the dialogue system realizes the dialogue and interaction between Character and NPC. Though setting different prerequisites and results， it can complete the effect of different choices violating different endings. Besides, the quest function guides the player to explore the room by setting up a series of quests.
